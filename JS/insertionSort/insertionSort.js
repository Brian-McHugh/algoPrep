/**
 * Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Insertion sort iterates over an array, growing a sorted array behind the current location.
 * It takes each element from the input and finds the spot, up to the current point,
 * where that element belongs. It does this until it gets to the end of the array.
 *
 * Insertion sort should be implemented as a stable sort. This means that equal elements
 * should retain their relative order. Numbers, as primitives, give us no way to check this,
 * so we'll be sorting objects with a value field, on which they will be sorted, like so:
 *
 * `[{value: 10}, {value: 5, order: 1}, {value: 5, order: 2}]`
 *
 * A stable sort must return `{value: 5, order: 1}, {value:5, order: 2}` in that order.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * EXTRA CREDIT:
 *
 * Refactor your sort to (optionally) take an explicit comparator function
 * as its second argument, so that callers can define arbitrary ways to sort elements.
 * See [Array.prototype.sort](http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/sort)
 * for an example of how this works (excerpt below):
 *
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` is less than `0`, sort `a` to a lower index than `b`, i.e. `a` comes first.
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` returns `0`, leave `a` and `b` unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements.
 * > If `comparator(a, b)` is greater than `0`, sort `b` to a lower index than `a`.
 *
 * If no comparator is given, just sort the elements using `<` or `>`.

// Example usage:
// insertionSort([{value: 2}, {value: 1}, {value: 3}]);
// yields [{value: 1}, {value: 2}, {value: 3}]


// O(n^2) | O(1) space
const insertionSort = (arr) => {
  // loop thru second num in array to the end
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let j = i+1;
    
    // at for loop index from above, work backwards
		// and swap nums that are out of order
    while (j > 0 && arr[j] < arr[j-1]) {
      swap(j, arr)
      j--;
    } 
  }
  return arr;
}

const swap = (index, array) => {
  let temp = array[index-1];
  array[index-1] = array[index];
  array[index] = temp;

  return array;
}

// Testing 
const ex_arr = [-10, -10, -9, -7, -7, -6, -5, -2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8, 9, 10];
console.log(insertionSort(ex_arr));
