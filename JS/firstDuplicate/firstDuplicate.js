Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to
a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence
has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated
numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller
index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are
no such elements, return -1.
